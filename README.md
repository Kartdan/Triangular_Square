In this flutter project, i had to build a EURO to RON converter.
I added a photo regarding this homework, and afterwards, i have added an input field, that only has numerical values.
By using a controller, i was able to get every value of the input field, when it was changed, and tried to parse it to a double value, so that it will be
converter to RON. If the number introduced isn't correct, then the user would receive an error text, telling him to introduce an actual number.
I thought that a real time converter would be more efficient rather than having a "convert" button, which the user would have to press everytime he wants to
convert a value. For the real time LEI value, i have used a text field, that changes its value through the controller.
Nothing else to say, i have used basic widgets and fields.
