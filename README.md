In this flutter project, i have built an app that detects if a number is either triangular, square, both, or neiter.
The input field receives an int value, and calculates if it is any of the cases above, and opens a dialogue telling you which case it is.
At the end, you can close it by pressing anywhere, and you can go on and try another number.
I have used a function for the dialogue, and some other widgets: Column, Text, Container, and buttons.
